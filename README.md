# Money Tracker
This is a simple Python API to read and modify a database, where the database contains two tables, "users" and "transactions." The API is able to create, read, and modify a database that contains **users** given IDs and usernames, as well as **transactions** given the user id, amount, date, and a category. The goal is simply to track income and outcome of the user's cashflow.

This repo is to practice `sqlite3`, `pandas`, and CI/CD.

TODO: Create a GUI to visualize the data.

## Requirements
    - Python 3.x.x
